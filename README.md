# Abstract:

Engagement is a key indicator of the quality of learning experience, and one that plays a major role in developing intelligent educational interfaces.
Any such interface requires the ability to recognise the level of engagement in order to respond appropriately; however, there is very little existing data to learn from, and new data is expensive and difficult to acquire. 

 For instance, if students feel frustrated and become disengaged (see disengaged samples in Fig. 1), the system should intervene in order to bring them back to the learning process. However, if students are engaged and enjoying their tasks (see engaged samples in Fig. 1), they should not be interrupte

# The problem:

Whether it be classrooms in Schools or an Ed-Tech platform, keeping the students engaged & connected is a common pain point which they all face.
Hence, Student Engagement is one of the pain points we are trying to solve. 

# Student Engagement

Student engagement plays a crucial role in education and benefits students, the college, and education partners.
It empowers students with the ability to acquire and practice the necessary skills to build a successful future. Helps in building better relationships with other students, staff, and faculty and helps the students understand governance within the institution’s education system. As a result, it improves student personality and enhances their skills that are necessary for driving change.

# The Bigger Picture

The goal of student engagement is said to be achieved when education partners also benefit. With the implementation of student engagement plans, there will be better bonding between education partners. This provides a better understanding of student’s varying needs to boost the campus experience and promotes a more responsive education system.
