# Abstract:

Engagement is a key indicator of the quality of learning experience, and one that plays a major role in developing intelligent educational interfaces.
Any such interface requires the ability to recognise the level of engagement in order to respond appropriately; however, there is very little existing data to learn from, and new data is expensive and difficult to acquire. 

 For instance, if students feel frustrated and become disengaged (see disengaged samples in Fig. 1), the system should intervene in order to bring them back to the learning process. However, if students are engaged and enjoying their tasks (see engaged samples in Fig. 1), they should not be interrupte

# The problem:

Whether it be classrooms in Schools or an Ed-Tech platform, keeping the students engaged & connected is a common pain point which they all face.
Hence, Student Engagement is one of the pain points we are trying to solve.
